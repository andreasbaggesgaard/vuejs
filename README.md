# vuejs

All the code for my learning experience with Vue.js. It covers basic workflow and then goes deeper with what Vue.js has to offer.  Projects:  Movie list with hover functionality. Basically including the vue.js library directly in the html file. Content Management System using a Vue.js CLI project including webpack and single file components. Also using Firebase for the database. Recipe search/filtering page. Integrating Vue.js into a ASP.NET Core MVC project and using TypeScript instead of single file components.
